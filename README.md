# Two-stage-gearbox-desing
This team-based project involved designing a two-stage gearbox with identical reductions to transmit 14 hp at 1500 rpm to a 66–77 rpm output. Gear stresses were evaluated using AGMA design equations, and shaft stresses were analyzed using von Mises criteria to ensure safe and reliable operation.
My Contributions

My primary contributions to this project focused on the analysis, validation, and implementation of the gearbox design.

Performed gear stress calculations using AGMA bending stress equations, including endurance limit evaluation, face-width sizing, and safety factor verification. These calculations were implemented and iterated in MATLAB to efficiently evaluate design changes.

Designed and analyzed the countershaft, accounting for combined bending and torsional loads and evaluating failure using von Mises criteria. Stress concentration effects from shoulders and keyways were explicitly included.

Developed detailed 3D CAD models of the shaft and gearbox components and conducted finite element analysis (FEA) to validate analytical results. FEA confirmed peak stresses at the second-stage pinion and keyway regions, consistent with hand calculations.

Produced engineering drawings, exploded views, and assembly models, and supported scaled redesign for 3D printing, including recalculating allowable power transmission for polycarbonate material.
