# Two-stage-gearbox-desing
This team-based project involved designing a two-stage gearbox with identical reductions to transmit 14 hp at 1500 rpm to a 66–77 rpm output. Gear stresses were evaluated using AGMA design equations, and shaft stresses were analyzed using von Mises criteria to ensure safe and reliable operation.
